    <h1>Long Live PeeWee</h1>
        <p>Dogs are my favorite type of animal. No matter what kind of day you've had, they are always happy to see you when you get home!
            My favorite breed of dog is chihuahua. The image is a picture of my dog PeeWee, He passed away in April of 2019. I miss him a lot.

        <p>He had two puppies, Howee and Tukee. Tukee was born with scoliosis, but that didn't stop her from living her best life.
            She was always so full of energy and happy. Unfortunately she passed away earlier this year.
