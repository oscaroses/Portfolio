# week-2-homework
This is an early webpage for myself
The index.html is the main page with information about myself.
The navigation bar at the top will take you to other parts of my project.
I used a Jumbotron to introduce myself and tell the user a little about myself.
Made a sticky footer with my name.
The portfolio page has some of my interests listed in the way of cards.
The images are responsive and will link you to a page about the interest in the image.
I gave a small description within the cards.
The contact page is a page where you can contact me. However, I do not know how to make the submit button to work yet. 
The final link will link you to my LinkedIn profile.
I hope you enjoy my project!
